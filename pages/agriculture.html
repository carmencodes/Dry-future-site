			<h2>Agriculture is Life</h2>
			<p>While golf courses are a luxury, the agriculture is essential in everyday life. Agriculture varies by
				location, but Arizona, specifically produces cotton, citrus, lettuce, alfalfa and other crops. The crops
				bring in a $2.4 billion profit to Arizona each year, which is a substantial number and helps support the
				efficient water usage for agriculture. At the same time, it uses approximately 70% of Arizona's water,
				and the majority of this water is used for irrigation.</p>
			<p>Ranches and farmers use water to irrigate fields and crops and for livestock to drink. In addition,
				according to Shaun McKinnon, writer and journalist at The Arizona Republic, ranchers, farmers and other
				members of the agribusiness industry maintain and control reservoirs that comprise Arizona's backup
				water supply that could be converted for other uses in times of severe drought. Large-scale farming
				could not provide food for the world's large populations without the irrigation of crop fields by water
				gotten from rivers, lakes and wells. Without irrigation, crops could never be grown in the desert of
				Arizona. There are several different systems that are used for irrigation purposes, including ditch
				irrigation, terracing, overhead irrigation, lateral move irrigation, drip or tickle irrigation and
				center pivot irrigation. (Source: <a href="http://academic.evergreen.edu/g/grossmaz/disruddj/"

			<p>The water shortage in Arizona is a real problem barely acknowledged by residents, golf courses, and
				construction companies which not only inadvertently send water down drains, but also do nothing to help
				preserve it. Still, Arizona farmers are working steadily towards reducing their water usage. In contract
				to golf companies, the agricultural industry provides a means to all other industries to thrive simply
				ways such as food for restaurants and grocery stores and employment for residents. </p>
			<p>Through the efforts of legislation, advancement in agricultural efficiency, and the steps taken by
				individual farmers, use of water resources in Arizona agriculture is already dropping. Agriculture also
				provides the framework for an emergency drought system in the form of water reservoirs maintained by
				ranches and farmers. Arizona truly cannot afford to lose this valuable asset to its economy, and
				agriculture should not be expected to cut back on its water usage any further.</p>
